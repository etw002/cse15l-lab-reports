# Lab Report 1
### Cd with no argument:

The current directory was the home directory. 
When cd is called without any arguments the user is returned to the home directory, however we were already in the home directory, so it didnâ€™t do anything. 
This output was not an error since it technically changed the directory to the home directory.
